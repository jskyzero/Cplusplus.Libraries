## Overview

```
There are two Linux C/C++ library types which can be created:

Static libraries (.a): Library of object code which is linked with, and becomes part of the application.
Dynamically linked shared object libraries (.so): There is only one form of this library but it can be used in two ways.
Dynamically linked at run time. The libraries must be available during compile/link phase. The shared objects are not included into the executable component but are tied to the execution.
Dynamically loaded/unloaded and linked during execution (i.e. browser plug-in) using the dynamic linking loader system functions.
```
